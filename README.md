# keyboard-shortcuts

So I've just recently bought myself a mac mini to get used to using OSX. This project is intended to map the shortcuts I regularly use on windows to their OSX equivalents.

For the shortcuts where there isn't a direct match, but there is a slightly different method, I'll note these down instead. This doesn't bother me too much, as long as there is a method of using the keyboard.

I've been a windows power user for quite a while, and main reason for not switching to apple has been the cost and the difference in speed I can use the platform. Hopefully this project will help me resolve that issue.
