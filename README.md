Keyboard Shortcuts for Windows and Mac
-----

So I've just recently bought myself a mac mini to get used to using OSX. This small project is intended for me to note down the windows keyboard shortcuts I use regularly and find the mac equivilents. Sometimes there isn't a direct match, but a different method. This works fine with me as long I know what there is.

I've been a windows power user for quite a while, and main reason for not switching to apple has been the cost but also the difference in speed I can use the platforms. This will help me resolve that issue slowly but surely, hopefully getting to the point where I justify purchasing a mac book pro or air.
